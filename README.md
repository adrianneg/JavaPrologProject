# JavaPrologProject

Given: Week of September 1, 2015

Due: Week of November 17, 2015

The Central Criminal Fighting Agency (CCFA) has had a string of mishaps that has brought much embarrassment to their department and there is consistent rise in crime plaguing the country.
In light of these failures the CCFA and Minister of National Security has created Task Force X to which you have been assigned. Your task is to develop an expert system that will be able to analyze case files and deduce relevant information for the CCFA.

Your expert system will be given four (4) files:
* Crime Organization File - This file contains the organization name, the interests of these organizations, the known operating locations of these organizations, the known weapons used by these organizations and the identifying traits of its members.
* Organization's Member File - This file contains a list of persons and the organization they belong to.
* Crime File - This file contains the pertinent information related to the crime.
* Suspect File - This file contains a list of suspects and the identifying traits of these persons.

After completing the case analysis you are expected to display to the user:
* The suspected criminal organization, if multiple organizations are suspected they should be ordered by most suspicious first.
* The suspect or suspects that committed the crime ordered by the most suspicious first, if no suspect could be identified please display the message "No Suspect Found".
* A list showing the known members of each organization.
* A list showing the known operating locations of each organization.
* A list showing the known weapons used by each organization.

You will be provided with sample data sets from previous successful cases to aid in designing the system.

Please note some assumptions: Only one suspect with a name can exist in this world, any citizen that matches a Organizations traits is automatically a member of that crime family, and a suspect must belong to an organization.

Requirements:
Students should work in groups of four (4) unless stated otherwise to build an expert system using PROLOG to solve criminal cases, identify suspects and deduce motives as well as identifying the workers for the different crime organizations.

At the completion of this project the group is required to submit the complete source code (correctly commented) and the project documentation. The project documentation should contains:
* The group members and the tasks completed by each group member
* The design of your program
* An explanation of the varying facts and rules of the system and how they are used and or asserted.
* The User Manual

Marking Scheme:

Marks will be awarded as follows:
* Facts (10%)
* Rules (15%)
* Persistence (10%)
* Functionality (35%)
* Proper use of facts and rules (10%)
* Proper use of PROLOG search mechanisms (5%)
* Robustness (5%)
* Correctness (15%)
* Documentation (15%)
* Comments (5%)
* Originality & Ingenuity (10%)

There will be an additional 10% for groups who provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for this system. This GUI should allow for the entering of case data.

Marks will be subtracted for late assignment at a rate of 10% per day. Assignments more than 3 days late will not be accepted. Please note weekends are counted as days.
